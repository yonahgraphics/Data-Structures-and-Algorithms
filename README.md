 <p>

Solving coding problems everyday keeps your mind sharp, makes you a great thinker and keeps you healthy :satisfied: :satisfied: :satisfied: <p>
In this repository you will find solutions to pupular coding problems asked by big tech companies like Facebook, Amazon Apple Netflix, Google Microsoft etc. I try to make the code as clear as possible, and the goal is be to used as a learning resource and a way to lookup specific problems easly. 
If have any questions or suggestions, please don't be afraid to ask. This repository is contribution friendly, so if you feel you want to contribute I'd happy to merge :blush::blush::blush:

# DATA STRUCTURES
 ### BINARY TREE
 Popular non-linear data structure. A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

 ### LINKEDLIST
 A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.
